	//Interfaces
	//We want to take a collection of shapes, call the Area() method on them and then check the result
	// So we can write a checkArea function that we can pass both Rectangles and Circles to, but fail to compile if we try to pass something that isnt a shape
	//Interfaces allow you to make functions that can be used with different types whilst still maintaining type safety

	//We are creating a helper function where we are asking for a Shape to be passed in - if something that isnt a shape is passed it will not clompile
	//now we just need to tell Go what a Shape interface is!
