//Why do we need to mock?
//our tests take 3 seconds to run every time - think about if the number was bigger thn 3
//we have a dependency on sleep - need to extract to be able to control - mock it
//if we can mock time.Sleep
//we can use dependency injection to use it instead of a "real" time.Sleep
//and then we can spy on the calls to make assertions on them.
