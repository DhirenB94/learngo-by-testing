// have assigned the test function (if got!= want part) to the assertCorrectMessage variable
// then used this variable instead of repeated if gotwant lines
//when using t.helper - use testing.TB as this gives access to both testing.T (test) and testing.B (benchmark)
//t.helper allows us to see exactly which line number the test fails at, comment it out to see the difference, it would fail within the test helper.
