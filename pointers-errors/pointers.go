//You would think this would return a passing test
//as you are depositing the amount variable (10) to the balance
//then the balance method should return the current state of it

//BUT NO
// In Go, when you call a function or a method, the arguements are copied!
//so when we call func(w Wallet)Deposit(amount int) --> the w is a copy of whatever we called the method from
